# TwitterPoliticalUnifier
Capstone project for the UofU Masters of Software Development program

This project was inspired by the excessive polarization in America's political climate today. Americans today need to find common ground with fellow citizens, even when their poltical views might differ. Polarized messages that appeal to exclusively to either liberals or conservatives is quite easy to create and spread. But to come up with a message that will appeal to those of differing political views is much more difficult. 

Using natural language processing (NLP) to classify users as either liberal or conservative, this application will help you understand how your message is being received by your fellow countrymen. Find the tweets that are liked most by people of all political affiliations!
