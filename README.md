Capstone project for the UofU Masters of Software Development program (in-progress)

This project was inspired by the excessive polarization in America's political climate today. Americans today need to find common ground with fellow citizens, even when their poltical views might differ. This app is intended to discover which messages appeals most to a broad range of people along the political spectrum.

Using natural language processing (NLP) and graph analysis to classify users along the political spectrum, this application will help you understand how your message is being received by your fellow countrymen. Find the tweets that are liked most by people of all political affiliations (soon)!
