**a description of the project(s) and the final deliverables**
I want to build a website that will aggregate links to videos hosted on other platforms (YouTube, Vimeo, Bitchute etc.).

The use case of my website will be to reduce the dependency on a single video hosting platform which has increasingly become a concern for both creators and users. When users want to watch a video, they will visit my website and get links to the videos from all the top hosting sites. They can choose to patron which ever website they wish from the list of links.

This will be initially a crowd sourced type of system. Users can post links to a video and be upvoted/downvoted based on their relevance or quality. The other way I can take this is to do a meta-search engine like you see here https://torrentz2.eu/

Open to suggestions.

**project milestones**

Milestones (not in order):
-	Video search and ranking
-	A voting system (ensure that it isn't easily exploitable)		
-	Perhaps I can find a way to get a hash of the videos to ensure that the URLs posted matches the intended content
- database
- UI

Potential features to implement later:
-	Automatically forwards you to the link with the least views as a way of “sharing” the views amongst platforms
-	“Verified” users can post their own links to this platform
-	Automatically upload content to many different content providers at once? **(this might be a capstone project in itself???)**

**the proposed mentor**
- Ben? Varun? Whoever is best at web development.

**skills/tools the you expect you'll need to learn/develop to complete the project**
- Web development tools
	- Backend would be either Python (Django framework) or JavaScript (Node.js)?
	- Front end would likely be React.

**"risks" that you think might make the project difficult/impossible, other concerns**
- I don’t expect any technical difficulties, but there is a wide range of social and possibly legal consequences:
- What happens when links videos that are banned elsewhere is hosted on my website? ISIS and child pornography is pretty easy to draw the line on. But Antifa, White Supremacist, school shooting content is a little murkier.
- Part of the point of this website is to prevent monopolies from shutting down content creators at a whim, but there has got to be a line somewhere, right?
- Likelihood of this project becoming popular enough that it causes a national emergency or am held legally responsible is low, but can I even talk about my project in an interview in a way that de-politicized/not polarized?
